# 4:1 Multiplexer

A 4:1 multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of four input signals using two select lines.
The binary value of the select inputs determines which data input is passed to the output.
// en0,en1 signals act as select lines for the multiplexer

4:1 multiplexers are commonly used in data routing, control logic, and as components in larger digital systems.
