# 2:1 Multiplexer

A 2:1 multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of two input signals based on a single select line.
// en signal acts as select line for the multiplexer

When the select signal is `0`, the first input is routed to the output.  
When the select signal is `1`, the second input is routed to the output.

2:1 multiplexers are basic building blocks used to construct larger multiplexing circuits.
