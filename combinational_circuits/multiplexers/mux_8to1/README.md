# 8:1 Multiplexer

An 8:1 multiplexer is a combinational circuit that selects one of eight input signals using three select lines.
The select lines form a binary value that identifies the input to be routed to the output.
// en0,en1,en2 signals act as select lines for the multiplexer


8:1 multiplexers are useful in complex data selection, signal routing, and hierarchical multiplexer designs.
