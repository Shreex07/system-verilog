# Half Adder

A half adder is a combinational circuit that adds two single-bit binary inputs.

It produces two outputs:
- **Sum**: the result of the addition
- **Carry**: indicates whether the addition generates a carry

A half adder does not account for any carry input and is commonly used as a basic building block in arithmetic circuits.
