# Full Adder

A full adder is a combinational circuit that adds three single-bit inputs: two data bits and a carry-in.

It produces two outputs:
- **Sum**: the result of the addition
- **Carry-out**: the carry generated from the addition

Full adders are fundamental components in multi-bit adders such as ripple-carry adders.
