# Tri-state Inverter

A tri-state inverter combines signal inversion with tri-state behavior.

When the enable signal is active, the output is the inverted form of the input.  
When the enable is inactive, the output is placed in a high-impedance (`Z`) state.

This type of circuit is useful in controlled signal inversion and bus-based digital systems.
