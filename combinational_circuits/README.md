# Combinational Circuits ⚙️

This folder contains SystemVerilog implementations of **combinational logic circuits**.  
The outputs of these circuits depend **only on the current inputs**, with no memory or storage elements involved.

Some designs may be implemented using different coding styles to explore multiple ways of describing the same logic.  
🔍 Explore the designs and try different approaches.

## 📂 Organization
The circuits are organized into subfolders based on their functionality.

## 🧩 Folder Structure
Each circuit folder typically contains:
- SystemVerilog design code (`.sv`)
- Testbench (`_tb.sv`)
- Simulation waveform (`.png`)
- A README explaining the circuit and its operation
