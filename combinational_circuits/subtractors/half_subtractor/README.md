# Half Subtractor

A half subtractor is a combinational circuit that subtracts one single-bit binary input from another.

It produces two outputs:
- **Difference**: the result of the subtraction
- **Borrow**: indicates whether a borrow is required

A half subtractor does not consider any borrow input and serves as a basic unit in subtraction circuits.
