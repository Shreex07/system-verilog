# Full Subtractor

A full subtractor is a combinational circuit that subtracts two single-bit inputs along with a borrow-in.

It produces two outputs:
- **Difference**: the result of the subtraction
- **Borrow-out**: indicates whether a borrow is generated

Full subtractors are used in multi-bit subtraction operations and arithmetic logic units.
