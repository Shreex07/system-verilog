# System Verilog Projects

This repository contains my System Verilog codes that I am building and uploading as part of my learning journey.
The codes are organized into folders based on circuit categories, such as basic gates, combinational circuits, sequential circuits, and more.
Each circuit will have its own folder inside the category folders, containing the design code, testbench, and simulation results.

## Tool Used
- Vivado Design Suite 2025.1 (for writing, simulating, and generating waveforms, RTL schematics, and block diagrams)

---

## Note
I will keep updating this repository as I learn and implement more digital design concepts in System Verilog.

🔧 Keep Designing, Keep Simulating!
