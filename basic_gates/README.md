# Basic Gates

This folder contains all the basic logic gates implemented in System Verilog.
All designs were created and simulated using **Vivado Design Suite 2025.1**, including waveform generation and RTL/block diagrams.  

The following gates will be included as separate subfolders:  
AND, OR, NOT, XOR, NAND, NOR, XNOR  

Each gate subfolder may include:
- Design code (`.sv`)
- Testbench (`_tb.sv`)
- Simulation waveform (`.png`)
- README about the gate
